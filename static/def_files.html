    <h2>SBtab - Standardised data tables for Systems Biology</h2>

    <h3>Upload your own SBtab definition file</h3>

    <p style="width:700;">Using SBtab definition tables you can define your
      very own SBtab table types that will then be parsed and understood
      by the online validator. Usually, a default SBtab definition table
      is set and can be downloaded <a href="files/definitions.tsv">here</a>.
      But on this page you can also upload your own definition file to
      establish your own SBtab table formats. Please only do this if you
      have read the <a href="files/SBtab_Specification.pdf">SBtab specification</a>
      and you understand how it is used.
      In any case you can always return to the default definition file by
      restarting your session.
